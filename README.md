# PlistPhotoManager

Made a plist filesystem for images that I wanted cached, but with a little more control over how it was stored (utilizing the NSDictionary native style of iOS because, well it's there)

The UI is there just so users can tinker around with it and see how the backend works with the frontend (and I guess i got a bit carried away being OCD)
